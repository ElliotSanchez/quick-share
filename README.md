# quick-share
Quick Share is a photo sharing app modeled after Grant Klimaytys' app of the same name from his Udemy course "The Complete iOS 10 Developer."
I have added my own improvements to both the aesthetics and function of the app in order to get app store approval.
The changes I have made from the course's sample code include:
  - Loading user photos on gaining initial photos access without requiring relaunch
  - Adding Dispatch call to eliminate long loading periods for large photo libraries
  - Removing non-functional sharing services from menus
  - Autolayout to enable use on all iPhone and iPad models
