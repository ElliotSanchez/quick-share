# quick-share
## Simple photo sharing / camera app. My first app store submission.

Originally based on sample code from ["The Complete iOS 10 Developer" Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ios-10-developer-course/) by Grant Klimaytys.

Although 2,000 students have taken the course, the example app had not yet been submitted because major improvments were needed before it would meet Apple's quality standards.

I was able to make the neccesary improvements and the app is now available in the app store.

My original contributions include:
* simple multi-threading for improved responsiveness
* permissions checking after initial failure
* camera roll reloading after permission change
* additional screen for full image review
* autolayout for multiple devices / universal app
* force touch on supported devices
* activity indicator on initial load
* custom colors and styling
